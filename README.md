## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run FinGenius AI locally for development.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** For running the application services.
*   **Node.js (LTS version) & npm/yarn:** For the frontend development.
*   **Python 3.9+:** (Optional, if you prefer to run backend services outside Docker for deeper debugging). We recommend using a tool like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) for Python dependency management.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fingenius-ai.git
cd fingenius-ai
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` files based on the provided examples in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

**`backend/.env` (example content):**

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@db:5432/fingenius_db"
REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379/0"
SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT_AND_SESSIONS"
PLAID_CLIENT_ID="your_plaid_client_id"
PLAID_SECRET="your_plaid_secret"
PLAID_ENV="sandbox" # or development, production
# Add other Plaid settings as needed (e.g., PLAID_PRODUCTS, PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES)
```

**`frontend/.env` (example content):**

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
REACT_APP_PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY="your_plaid_public_key"
REACT_APP_PLAID_ENV="sandbox"
```

*   **Important:** Replace placeholder values with your actual secrets and API keys. For local development, `YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT_AND_SESSIONS` can be a random string. For Plaid, you'll need to create a developer account to get your keys.

### 3. Run with Docker Compose (Recommended for Local Dev)

This will set up the PostgreSQL database, Redis, Celery worker, and both the FastAPI backend and React frontend services.

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

*   `--build`: Rebuilds images (useful if you made changes to Dockerfiles).
*   `-d`: Runs containers in detached mode (in the background).

Wait a few moments for all services to start. You can check the status with `docker-compose ps`.

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

Once the backend service is up (you can check its logs with `docker-compose logs backend`), apply the database migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend sh /app/scripts/apply_migrations.sh
```

This script typically runs `alembic upgrade head` inside the backend container.

### 5. Access the Application

*   **Frontend:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
*   **Backend API Docs:** The FastAPI interactive API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Running Backend/Frontend Separately (Advanced)

If you need to run specific services outside Docker for detailed debugging:

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
# Using Poetry for dependency management (install if you don't have it)
# poetry install
# poetry run alembic upgrade head
# poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install # or yarn install
npm start   # or yarn start
```

### Running Tests

**Backend Tests:**

```bash
docker-compose exec backend poetry run pytest
# Or if running locally:
# cd backend
# poetry run pytest
```

**Frontend Tests:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm test # or yarn test
```
